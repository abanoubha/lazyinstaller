# LazyInstaller

LazyInstaller is a simple tool to install and manage packages on your system.

It is a wrapper around package managers like apt, yum, dnf, zypper, etc.

It is a TUI (terminal user interface) for [project i the installer](https://github.com/abanoubha/i). *i the installer* is an abstraction layer over the package managers of macOS, different Linux distributions, and Windows.
